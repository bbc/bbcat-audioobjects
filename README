IMPORTANT

This library (along with bbcat-control) is now DEPRECATED and has been replaced by the following two libraries:
bbcat-adm - https://github.com/bbcrd/bbcat-adm.git
bbcat-fileio - https://github.com/bbcrd/bbcat-fileio.git

The classes, files and APIs have *not* changed, only the location of files have changed, for example:
bbcat-control/AudioObjectParameters.h is now bbcat-adm/AudioObjectParameters.h 
bbcat-audioobjects/ADMData.h is now bbcat-adm/ADMData.h 
bbcat-audioobjects/RIFFFile.h is now bbcat-fileio/RIFFFile.h 
bbcat-audioobjects/TinyXMLADMData.h is now bbcat-fileio/TinyXMLADMData.h 

bbcat-control and bbcat-audioobjects will still compile and work but will NOT be updated.
