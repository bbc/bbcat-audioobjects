bbcat-audioobjects (0.1.2.1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Split ADMData class into ADMData and XMLADMData classes.  ADMData handles 'in-memory' ADM's whereas XMLADMData handles encoding and decoding of chna and axml chunks.  TinyXMLADMData now derives from XMLADMData
  * Changed creation of audioTrackUID objects (ADMAudioTrack's) to choose next highest track number by default
  * Added ADMXMLGenerator as simple XML generator (used by XMLADMData but can be used with just ADMData)
  * Updated examples after changes to bbcat-control/AudioObjectParameters
  * Updated Playlist to support pausing and playlist index manipulation
  * Other minor improvements and fixes
